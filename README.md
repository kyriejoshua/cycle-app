# Cycle-App

## Introduce

* Now it's a demo for cycle.js and rxjs.
* Hoping it can help me learning rxjs and cycle.js.

### Required

* Please use node v6.6.0.

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server

  npm test
    Start the test runner

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production

  npm run take-off-training-wheels
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!
